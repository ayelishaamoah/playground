TypeScript 

Transcompiles (one language in - another language out) into JavaScript but adds optional statuc typing.

Uses a ``.ts`` extension

Can be used for client-side and server-side programming.

greeter.js - created using the quick start tutorial in the docs https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html

Running ```tsc <filename>.ts``` will run the compiler and output a JavaScript file.
