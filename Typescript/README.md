# TypeScript 

Transcompiles (one language in - another language out) into JavaScript but adds optional statuc typing.

Uses a ``.ts`` extension

Can be used for client-side and server-side programming.

greeter.js - created using the quick start tutorial in the docs https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html

Running ```tsc <filename>.ts``` will run the compiler and output a JavaScript file.

### Interfaces
An interface allows us to describe the fields we expect to be present on a specified object type. If two objects have the same internal structure i.e the fields match, they are considered to be of the same type.
